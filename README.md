# Task Manager

## Overview
This Task Manager consists of a graphical interface using the 
customtkinter library linked to a task list (`tasks.json` file) 
and a file that lists the tasks (`log` file) that have been completed.

On the central panel, you can view the tasks completed based on the 
selected time period. On the left, there are temporary tasks to be 
completed. At the bottom, an input bar allows the addition of new 
temporary tasks. On the right, you can see the list of constant tasks 
set by the user.
